# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Deployment process for the kubearchinspect project.
#
# A single "Upgrade a Helm Chart" step that:
#   - pulls the chart from the Octopus built-in feed. The CI workflow packages
#     the chart and `octopus package upload`s the .tgz to the built-in feed at
#     the same version as the image, so the release version drives the chart.
#   - sets image.repository / image.tag via inline YAML values. The image still
#     lives in ECR and is pulled by the kubelet; only the *chart* moved feeds.
#     image.tag = #{Octopus.Release.Number}.
#   - runs on the Kubernetes Agent target (matched by its target tags).
#
# WHY THE BUILT-IN FEED (and not the ECR chart feed): an AWS ECR feed always
# acquires via Octopus's DockerImagePackageDownloader, which shells out to the
# `docker` CLI. On a Kubernetes Agent the step runs in a script pod whose image
# (octopusdeploy/worker-tools) ships helm + kubectl but NOT docker, so agent-
# side acquisition fails with "docker: command not found". Octopus has no
# OCI/Helm feed type for the Helm step (roadmap only), so the only way to keep
# acquisition on the agent — no docker, no Server — is to deliver the chart
# through a non-docker feed. The built-in feed transfers the package over the
# Tentacle protocol, so acquisition_location = "ExecutionTarget" works in-
# cluster with no docker and without the Server running the step.
#
# NOTE: the v1 provider does not strongly-type Helm actions — the keys below are
# the raw Octopus action properties (confirmed against Octopus's own config-as-
# code example for Octopus.HelmChartUpgrade). If you tweak the step in the UI,
# re-export to confirm any added property keys.
